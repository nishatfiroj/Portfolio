      <Paper small>
        I co-created Listening Parties (LPs), with music playback, live
        interaction and chat, streaming to the main app, and an artist store, to
        enable artists to communicate and earn revenue with thousands of fans at
        once. I accomplished this in under 6 months to enable artists to connect
        with their fans, earn thousands of dollars, and create new streams of
        revenue for Spotify

        <Paper>
          An LP is a single page Next.js app, utilizing React and Typescript
          technologies, with life cycle stages including the RSVP phase, Hype
          phase, Test phase, Live phase, and Ended phase.
          <Break />
          LPs manage data by having clients send HTTP requests to a data layer,
          which then orchestrates all data points to relevant backend micro
          services. All events are then disseminated to all attendees over a
          WebSocket connection, where the client synchronizes all streamed
          content via client level state management system.
          <Break />
          Client state management was built in house, using custom reducers,
          hooks, and providers, to synchronize streamed Spotify playback and
          audio.

          One of my key achievements was the planning, design, and
          implementation of a data orchestration layer, that enabled users to
          make purchases directly from their favorite artists. TL;DR, my plan
          involved horizontally slicing the architectural build, to meet tight
          deadlines and still effectively merge old and new backend services
          into one orchestration layer. In addition to improving the user
          experience, this helped Spotify see a notable rise in revenue and
          streams.
          <Break /> I led the demos and QA sessions for LPs, not only within the
          immediate team, but also for hundreds of other Spotifiers, engineering
          directors, and other Spotify leadership.

          These frontend and backend systems were all built using a tech
          principles document that I co-wrote, to guide all engineers towards
          building a well organized, robust, future-proof system of
          repositories.
          <Break />
          The entire repository had over 100k lines of code and had 50% coverage
          in terms of unit tests, synthetic tests, and more.
          <Break /> I wrote documentation for all testing and QA procedures for
          LPs.
